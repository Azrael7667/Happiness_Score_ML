# Happiness Score Prediction

## Overview
This project analyzes and predicts global happiness scores based on socio-economic indicators. It involves **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, model training, evaluation, and interpretability analysis (SHAP, LIME)** to uncover key insights. A **web application** has been deployed to allow real-time happiness score predictions.

## Web Application
The web application allows users to input key socio-economic factors and predict happiness scores. It is accessible at:

**[Happiness Score Predictor](https://predictor-happiness-score.onrender.com/)**

---

## Features
- **Data-Driven Prediction:** Multiple machine learning models, including Extra Trees, XGBoost, LightGBM, and SVR, predict happiness scores.
- **High Accuracy:** Advanced feature selection and hyperparameter tuning optimize model performance.
- **User-Friendly Deployment:** A web interface built with **Flask** allows real-time predictions.
- **Explainable AI:** SHAP analysis provides insights into how each feature impacts happiness scores.

---

## Dataset
The dataset contains World Happiness Reports from **2015 to 2019**, featuring:
- **GDP per Capita**
- **Social Support**
- **Life Expectancy**
- **Freedom**
- **Corruption**
- **Generosity**

These socio-economic indicators help predict the happiness score for different countries.

## Project Structure
1. **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**: Cleaning, handling missing values, and normalizing data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing trends using histograms, scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps.
3. **Feature Selection**: Identifying the most influential factors for happiness.
4. **Model Training & Optimization**: Training multiple regression models and selecting the best-performing one.
5. **Model Interpretability (SHAP)**: Understanding feature contributions to model predictions.
6. **Deployment**: Building a web interface using **Flask** for real-time happiness score predictions.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### Histograms and Boxplots
Histograms were used to analyze the distribution of features, while boxplots identified outliers.

### Correlation Heatmap
A correlation matrix was generated to analyze relationships between happiness scores and predictors.

### Happiness Trends Over Time
Line plots were used to track happiness scores over **five years**.
